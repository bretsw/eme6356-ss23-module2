# `r fa("thumbs-up", fill = "#fff")` <br><br> Looking Back at Module 1

# `r fa("thumbs-up", fill = "#fff")` Defining "big data"

```{r, out.width = "540px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}

### The three Vs of big data (Russom, 2011, p. 6)

# `r fa("thumbs-up", fill = "#fff")` Optimism about Analytics

```{r, out.width = "360px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}

**Opportunities:**

--

- help decision-making

--

- treat patients

--

- monitor parking

--

- prepare stock in preparation of hurricanes

--

- monitor studentsâ€™ self-regulated learning, performance, and engagement

---

# `r fa("thumbs-up", fill = "#fff")` Pessimism about Analytics

```{r, out.width = "360px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/caution.jpg")
```

--

**Challenges:**

--

- Misuse of big data, fake news, privacy issues, data security and other ethical considerations
  
--

- Surveillance issues

--

- Leaving digital traces and footprints in online spaces
  
--

- Analytics reports can be lengthy and difficulty to understand

--

- Lack of infrastructure for implementation of analytics in many contexts

### Analytics Problem Plan (100 points) - **due end of Module 3**

--

- "Write a brief report (approximately 750-1000 words) identifying and describing a real-world problem that might be addressed via analytics."

--

- "The emphasis of this assignment is on the conceptualization of the problem and the clear identification of a possible data source."

--

- "Then briefly describe how analytics will be used to solve the problem" 

--

- "You will not need to collect actual data related to this problem, just plan for how it would be done."
